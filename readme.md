# Overview

The project explores core image processing techniques:

Perspective vs Orthographic Projection

Comparison between true perspective and approximate orthographic images.

Histogram Equalization & Matching

Global histogram equalization and histogram matching with a target image.

Derivatives & Derivative of Gaussian (DoG)

Edge detection using both naïve derivative filters and derivative-of-Gaussian filters.

Image Sharpening (Unsharp Masking)

Enhancement of details using high-frequency components, with examples at different blending weights (α).

Anisotropic Diffusion vs Gaussian Filtering

Noise reduction while preserving edges, compared against Gaussian smoothing.
