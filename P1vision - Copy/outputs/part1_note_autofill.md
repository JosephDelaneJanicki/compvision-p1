**Files:** `desk_close.jpg` (perspective) and `desk_far.jpg`.

In the perspective image, parallel edges in the 3D scene **converge** in the 2D photo,
indicating a vanishing point (estimated at (918.2, 264.9)). This illustrates foreshortening: parts farther from the
camera project to smaller spans.

In the orthographic image (captured by stepping back and zooming/croppingâ€”the same edges appear more parallel
and show less convergence, better approximating parallel projection rays.

Visually: perspective emphasizes depth but distorts shape with distance; the orthographic-like framing preserves proportions
more uniformly in the central region.
